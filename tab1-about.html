    The War
   </h3>
    <ul>
       <li>Yemen has been in the middle of an ongoing war for <strong> over 5 years </strong> and is facing the harsh repercussions. </li>
       <li>During the Arab Spring of 2011, Yeminis rose up against their president Ali Abdullah Saleh. </li>
    </ul>
    <div class="imgSize">
    <ul>
       <li>Saudi Arabia, a part of the Gulf Cooperation Council (a group of 6 Middle Eastern countries with the hope to achieve unity among its <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Gulf-Cooperation-Council" target="_blank">members</a>) negotiated to remove Saleh from power and replaced him with the vice president Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi.</li>
       <li>Yemen still suffered under President Hadi even after the revolution so two rebel fighter groups named the <strong> Houthis </strong> and the <strong> Salehs </strong> (president Saleh's followers) made an alliance and decided to overthrow him.</li>
        <li>The war started in 2014 when the Houthi-Saleh rebel alliance group attacked and took control of Yemen's capital, Sana'a.</li>
        <li>Hadi, the president at the time, called to Saudi-Arabia for help to regain control of the governement</li>
        <li>Saudi-Arabia and their coalition started a campaign of airstrikes,set up a naval blockade and deployed ground forces onto Yemen.</li>
       </ul>

   </div>
   <ul>
        <li> These stikes are what caused the famine and <strong>worsened </strong> their health care system</li>
        <li> To make matters worse, Saudi-Arabia believes the Houthis are funded military-wise by <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-42008809" target="_blank">Iran.</a></li>
    </ul>

Of those, 2 million are internally displaced people, 17 million are food insecure, and 14.4 million people do not have access to sanitation or clean drinking water" width= "10" height= "400">   

  <h3 class="homepageTitle">
    Food Insecurity
  </h3>
    <ul>
        <li> Since the war in early 2015 started, not only has Yemen's infrastructure been damaged but so has its food supply.  </li>
        <li> Food insecurity is the lack of realiable access to food that is both affordable and nutritious. Over <strong>20 million </strong> Yeminis are food insecure, which accounts for about <strong>70% of the population </strong>.</li>
        <li> The famine is man-made and caused by the war. Many civilians have not been paid which means they can not pay for <strong> basic necessities </strong>, such as food, water, and sanitation. Even if they did have money, food is very unaccessible due to the de facto blockades that are present during war-time.  </li>
        <li>Before the war, Yemen was heavily dependent on imported foods; <strong> ninety percent </strong> of the food in Yemen was imported. Two of those being rice and wheat which are staple foods in the country.
        <li>The Houthi/Saleh alliance has gained control of many land and sea ports which bring in <strong> revenue, food, and fuel </strong>. Many of the ports have been destroyed by the war and don't have a substitute. This caused the availability of food to decrease significantly. </li>
        <li> The <strong> main </strong> form of income in Yemen comes from the <strong> agriculture sector </strong> and since the fuel prices have risen, so have the water and irrigation costs which leads farmers atray due to the increased price. Fishermen have been impacted in the same way; fuel prices for the ships have increased.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>


  <h3 class="homepageTitle">
    The Pandemic & Epidemic
  </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Among war and famine, Yemen is facing a pandemic and epidemic at the same time. We thought COVID-19 was bad, but how about COVID-19 <strong>along with</strong> cholera?</li>
        <li>Yemen has been experiencing the largest cholera outbreak since 2016, with over 2 million cases to date. Not only caused by a lack of supplies, but also the lack of quick response and continuous bombings that have destroyed essential infrastructure and displayed thousands of people.</li> 
        <li>Even before the outbreak, <strong>half of all children under 5</strong> had <strong>chronic malnutrition</strong>, <strong>decreasing their resilience</strong> towards cholera.</li>
        <li>Oral Cholera Vaccines (OCVs) were not delivered until nearly 16â€‰months into the outbreak, allowing cholera to spread <strong>rapidly.</strong></li>
        <li>1 in 4 cases of cholera were children in 2019.</li> 
        <li>The UN estimates that <strong>16 million people</strong> lack access to safe water and sanitation, and <strong>16.4 million</strong> lack access to proper healthcare.</li>
     </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
